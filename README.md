# Nigeria-Covid-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This project provides data analytics skills in collecting, exploring, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights of COVID-19 data central to Nigeria in terms of penetration of the virus across each states, Real Domestic Gross Product and State Budget in relation to the pandemics.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

# PROJECT OBJECTIVE
In this project, data science and analytics skills are employed to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.

## DATA INFORMATION 
The data source is divided into different parts, and combined to perform analysis and provide insights. 

1. The Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) monitors the country’s COVID-19 situation, and releases data on the states affected by the virus, the number of cases on confirmation and admission, number of discharged, and number of death.

2. The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) publishes daily data on confirmed, death and recovered cases across different countries. The data for Nigeria will only be extracted from there.

3. Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index data. The vulnerability index was computed by considering several factors such as socio-economic status, population density, housing type, transportation, epidemiological, health system etc., these factors are known as themes.



4. The Real Domestic Gross Product(GDP) data for Nigeria will help to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. 


5. State Budget Data will also be used to determine the impact of COVID-19 on the economy across the states in the country.

# ANALYSIS QUESTION
Some questions that my exploration seek to answer upon analysis of given data and the data collected from diverse sources are:

1. Explore the distribution of the virus spread across each states, the numeric effect on each state through the distribution of the confirmed, discharged and the death cases in Nigeria states.

2.From John Hopkin’s data, get the active cases in all countries and extracting the data for  Nigeria out for analysis to help investigate the relationship between the aforementioned features and to draw conclusions based on their relation. 

3. Examine the connection between the number of confirmed cases, recovery cases, and deaths in order to calculate the infection rate throughout the country. Investigate and draw conclusions from the distribution of the infection rate over the date provided in the dataset.

4. An exploration and evaluation of specific indicators within external data are being conducted. These indicators comprise of Fragility, vulnerability, epideiology, prevalence, health care, population density, transportation and socioeconomic factors.  

5. The data will be explored using these indices in order to create graphs and charts that are more effective for conveying information and drawing  conclusions. 

6. The external GDP data will be analyzed to obtain a better understanding of the impact of covid-19 pandemic on the economy of the country.

7. Deeper understanding of the impact of the virus on Nigeria's economy, and additional insights will  be obtained from state and budgetary considerations. 

# ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
1. Web scraping, and importing from data sources.

2. Good use of Pandas and visualization tools to communicate insights.

3. Summary report documentation to derive more insights.

# CONCLUSION
After analyzing and drawing insights from data given, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the economy of Nigeria and the lives of its citizens during the period of prevalence. It is important to note that the leaders of the country should take measures to combat both the health and economic effects of this pandemic.
